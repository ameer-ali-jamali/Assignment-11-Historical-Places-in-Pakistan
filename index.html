                        Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state,
                        northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to
                        immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631,
                        having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most
                        famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the
                        southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank
                        of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

                Here’s a famous landmark of Pakistan for you: the Makli Necropolis, one of the largest funerary sites in the world!

                The site- which houses over 500,000 tombs- is spread out over an area of 10km near the Sindhi city of Thatta. The tombs were built over a 400 year period and belong to royalty, Sufi saints, and admired scholars.
                
                Makli began when Sufi saint Shaikh Jamali established a sort of Sufi gathering site and was eventually buried there. Later on in the 14th century, Trakhan ruler Jam Tamachi wished to be buried there as well seeing as he venerated Shaikh Jamali, and so began the tradition.

                    <strong>Mohenjo-Daro</strong>
                    <img src="/images/mohenjo-daro.jpg.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>You won’t have a complete list of historical places in Pakistan without including Mohenjo- Daro- one
                    of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. The ancient city, which is a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site, was built around 2500 BCE and remained undocumented for over 3700 years until
                    archeologists discovered it in the early 1920’s.

                    Mohenjo-Daro’s size (over 300 hectares) and inclusion of public buildings seem to represent a high
                    level of social organization according to historians. Wild right?

                    You can find Mohenjo-Daro near the city of Larkana in Pakistan’s Sindh Province where it can then
                    easily be reached by taxi.</p>

                    This example of military architectural excellence sits about 15km away from the city of Jhelum is
                    one of the best historical places to visit in Punjab for good reason!

                    Construction of the fort began in 1541 under the reign of Sher Shah Suri, an ethnic Pashtun who took
                    control of the Mughal empire in 1538.

                    Rohtas Fort spreads out over an area of 70 hectares and is considered to be one of the largest and
                    most formidable fortresses in South Asia. It’s located about 2 hours from Islamabad and 4 hours from
                    Lahore.

                    <strong>Hiran Minar</strong>
                    <img src="/images/taxila.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
<p>
    The Hiran Minar is one of the most popular historical places in Pakistan as far as visits are concerned. And though it is a tomb- this one is a bit different than others!

Most tombs in Punjab and across Pakistan house the remains of saints or royals but the Hiran Minar is dedicated not to Mughal Emperor Jahangir, but his pet antelope.

Yup you read that right- Emperor Jahangir was known for his love of nature and the Hiran Minar exemplifies that. It’s also set in a bit of a wilderness, which gave the Mughals a bit of a natural escape from the bustling city of Lahore.

The complex consists of a minaret built over the antelope along with a massive pool and accompanying pavilion.

And seeing that it’s only one hour from Lahore in Sheikhupura, the Hiran Minar is an easy day’s getaway.

                    <strong>Katasraj Temples
                    </strong>

                        Hindu temples in Pakistan- say what?! Yup you read that right- the Katasraj Temples are located
                        near the village of Dulmial in Punjab and are said to be from the 7th Century CE or earlier. The
                        temples surround a lake that is even fabled to have magical powers!

                        The famous Hindu epic Mahabharata also gives them a mention, and it’s well known that the
                        founder of the Sikh Faith- Guru Nanak- often visited the site in more recent centuries.

                        Sadly, the temples fell into a state of disarray post-Partition and still remain in
                        less-than-stellar shape today. Nevertheless, as far as historical buildings in Pakistan go- the
                        Katasraj Temples speak to the complicated history of the Subcontinent in a way few other
                        structures can.

                        The temples are located in Katas, which is about 2 hours from Islamabad and 3 hours from Lahore
