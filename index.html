                    <strong>Taj-Mahal</strong>
                    <img src="/images/Taj-Mahal.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state,
                        northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58) to
                        immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631,
                        having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most
                        famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the
                        southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank
                        of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.</p>

                    <strong>Begum Shahi Mosque</strong>
                    <img src="/images/begum-2.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>Colloquially known as the “Mother of all Mosques,” the Begum Shahi Mosque was built between 1611 and
                    1614 under Emperor Jahangir in honor of his mother, Mariam Zamani.
                    The relatively small mosque sits across the way from the famous Lahore Fort, and is one of the
                    oldest historical places in Lahore and is actually the city’s oldest surviving Mughal Era structure!

                    <strong>Mohenjo-Daro</strong>
                    <img src="/images/mohenjo-daro.jpg.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>You won’t have a complete list of historical places in Pakistan without including Mohenjo- Daro- one
                    of the largest cities of the Indus Valley Civilization. The ancient city, which is a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site, was built around 2500 BCE and remained undocumented for over 3700 years until
                    archeologists discovered it in the early 1920’s.

                    Mohenjo-Daro’s size (over 300 hectares) and inclusion of public buildings seem to represent a high
                    level of social organization according to historians. Wild right?

                    You can find Mohenjo-Daro near the city of Larkana in Pakistan’s Sindh Province where it can then
                    easily be reached by taxi.</p>

                <p>
                    This example of military architectural excellence sits about 15km away from the city of Jhelum is
                    one of the best historical places to visit in Punjab for good reason!

                    Construction of the fort began in 1541 under the reign of Sher Shah Suri, an ethnic Pashtun who took
                    control of the Mughal empire in 1538.

                    Rohtas Fort spreads out over an area of 70 hectares and is considered to be one of the largest and
                    most formidable fortresses in South Asia. It’s located about 2 hours from Islamabad and 4 hours from
                    Lahore.

                    <strong>Taxila</strong>
                    <img src="/images/taxila.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
               <p>So many historical sites in Pakistan happen to be ancient civilizations- and the lost city of Taxila is one of them! The origin of the city dates back to 1000 BCE, though some ruins at the site are thought to be as old as 3360 BCE. Woah!

                Due to its strategic location just off the Grand Trunk Road, it changed hands many a time throughout its history.
                
                Interestingly, the University of Ancient Taxila is considered to be one of the oldest in the world, though this is still disputed amongst scholars. In 1980, the entire city was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                
                Keep in mind that Taxila is not just one spot but rather more than a dozen ancient structures that include a cave, a monastery, stupas and more spread out over a pretty wide area.
                
                There is also a museum near the ruins that charges an entry fee.
                
                Due to its close proximity to Islamabad (32 km), Taxila has long been one of the most popular historical places in Pakistan and can be easily visited as a day trip from the capital.</p>

<p>Lahore is chock-full of incredible pieces of history and it can easily have its own list. But as for this one, the beautiful Wazir Khan Mosque is a must- mention. The mosque took its architectural queues from that from the Begum Shahi, and though the similarities are evident, the Wazir Khan is notably larger and more colorful.
